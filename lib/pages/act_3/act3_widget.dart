                              'Alexis was pumped to start making some real change. He had worked with the student government before, helping them run some environmental projects around campus. Thanks to that and professor Rachel Carson, he got an official position focusing on sustainability initiatives.  \n\nAlexis now was the Sustainability Program Coordinator. Lame, but he didn\'t care. He was just excited to get started. \n\nOver the next few weeks, Alexis learned that university politics weren\'t as easy as he thought. Every idea he pitched at meetings got shot down by the executive board. Reducing plastic waste on campus? Too expensive. Meatless Mondays at the dining halls? Students will complain. More bike lanes? Not enough room in the budget. \n\nAlexis was frustrated, but he refused to give up. He decided to launch a grassroots campaign to build support for sustainability initiatives from the ground up. He partnered with environmental student groups to host movie screenings and panels to raise awareness. He organized campus clean-ups and tree plantings that got lots of students involved. He started an online petition for a new recycling program that quickly gained thousands of signatures. \n\nSlowly but surely, Alexis started to make progress. Students overwhelmingly supported recycling and waste reduction efforts. The university even agreed to build more bike lanes and pedestrian paths in the next budget. \n\nBy his senior year, Alexis had made sustainability an integral part of campus life. The highlight was when the university president announced a major new carbon neutrality initiative at an Earth Day celebration. Alexis was stunned when the president called him on stage and thanked him for his leadership. As he looked out at the cheering crowd, Alexis realized he had accomplished more than he ever imagined.\n\nNow graduation was approaching, and Alexis had some big decisions to make. He had two major offers. To work with the state government office on sustainability programs, or a high-paying job at a nice company, not really involved with sustainability but great career develpment.',
